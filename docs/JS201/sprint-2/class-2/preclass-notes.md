## Where does Javascript code run?

* JS was originally designed to run only in client-side**browsers**
  * every browser has a j***avascript engine*** that can execute javascript code
  * google chrome's JS engine is**V8**
  * firefox's JS engine is**SpiderMonke** y
* **Node** is a cross-platform environment; Using node we can execute Javascript code in any operating system (desktops & servers); Node uses google chrome's V8 engine to execute JS code literally anywhere.

In other words, ***browsers*** and **n*ode*** provide a runtime environment for our Javascript code.

## What is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is just a specification. Javascript is a **programming language** that conforms to the specifications.

An organization called **ECMA** is responsible for defining standards.
